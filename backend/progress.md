# Banking + E-Commerce API Development Progress

## Project Overview
Building a banking + e-commerce REST API using Go standard library with JWT authentication, money transfers, and inventory management.

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Project Setup & Authentication
- [ ] Go module initialization
- [ ] Basic project structure
- [ ] User model and authentication
- [ ] JWT token implementation
- [ ] Registration and login endpoints
- [ ] Password hashing with bcrypt
- [ ] Authentication middleware

### Phase 2: Banking System
- [ ] Account model and management
- [ ] Account creation and listing
- [ ] Balance management
- [ ] Money transfer functionality
- [ ] Transfer validation and safety
- [ ] Banking transaction history

### Phase 3: E-Commerce System
- [ ] Product model and catalog
- [ ] Inventory management
- [ ] Product CRUD operations (admin)
- [ ] Purchase functionality
- [ ] Stock validation and deduction
- [ ] Purchase history

### Phase 4: Transaction Management
- [ ] Unified transaction logging
- [ ] Transaction history endpoints
- [ ] Transaction status tracking
- [ ] Comprehensive audit trail

### Phase 5: Security & Validation
- [ ] Input validation for all endpoints
- [ ] Error handling improvements
- [ ] Rate limiting
- [ ] Security audit
- [ ] Authorization checks

### Phase 6: Testing & Quality
- [ ] Unit tests for core functionality
- [ ] Integration tests
- [ ] Concurrency testing
- [ ] Financial accuracy testing
- [ ] Performance testing

### Phase 7: Production Readiness
- [ ] Logging system
- [ ] Health checks
- [ ] Configuration management
- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] Deployment preparation

## Current Status
**Phase:** Planning
**Progress:** 0/7 phases completed

## Data Models to Implement

### Core Models
- [ ] User (authentication, profile)
- [ ] Account (banking accounts)
- [ ] Product (e-commerce catalog)
- [ ] Transfer (money transfers)
- [ ] Purchase (product purchases)
- [ ] Transaction (unified transaction log)

## API Endpoints to Implement

### Authentication (Phase 1)
- [ ] POST /auth/register
- [ ] POST /auth/login
- [ ] POST /auth/logout
- [ ] GET /auth/me

### Banking (Phase 2)
- [ ] POST /accounts
- [ ] GET /accounts
- [ ] GET /accounts/{id}
- [ ] PUT /accounts/{id}
- [ ] DELETE /accounts/{id}
- [ ] POST /transfers
- [ ] GET /transfers
- [ ] GET /transfers/{id}

### E-Commerce (Phase 3)
- [ ] GET /products
- [ ] GET /products/{id}
- [ ] POST /products (admin)
- [ ] PUT /products/{id} (admin)
- [ ] DELETE /products/{id} (admin)
- [ ] POST /purchases
- [ ] GET /purchases
- [ ] GET /purchases/{id}

### Transactions (Phase 4)
- [ ] GET /transactions
- [ ] GET /transactions/{id}

## Key Technical Challenges

### Financial System Challenges
1. **Decimal Precision** - Avoid floating point errors in money calculations
2. **Transaction Safety** - Ensure atomic operations for transfers
3. **Concurrency Control** - Handle concurrent balance modifications
4. **Balance Consistency** - Maintain accurate balances at all times
5. **Audit Trail** - Comprehensive transaction logging

### Inventory Management Challenges
1. **Stock Consistency** - Prevent overselling
2. **Concurrent Purchases** - Handle simultaneous stock access
3. **Stock Validation** - Ensure sufficient inventory
4. **Atomic Operations** - Stock deduction with payment processing

### Security Challenges
1. **JWT Implementation** - Secure token generation/validation
2. **Password Security** - Proper hashing and storage
3. **Authorization** - User can only access own resources
4. **Input Validation** - Prevent injection attacks
5. **Error Handling** - No information leakage

### Go-Specific Challenges
1. **Manual Routing** - No framework routing
2. **Concurrency** - Proper mutex usage
3. **Error Handling** - Comprehensive error management
4. **JSON Handling** - Proper serialization/deserialization
5. **Testing** - Unit and integration tests

## Success Metrics
- [ ] All endpoints working correctly
- [ ] Zero balance inconsistencies
- [ ] No overselling of products
- [ ] Secure authentication system
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage
- [ ] Clean, maintainable code
- [ ] Proper error handling
- [ ] Thread-safe operations

## Interview Focus Areas
- Financial system architecture
- Concurrency and thread safety
- Authentication and authorization
- Data consistency and ACID properties
- Error handling in critical systems
- Testing strategies for financial systems
- Performance considerations
- Security best practices

## Next Steps
1. Initialize Go module
2. Create basic project structure
3. Implement User model and authentication
4. Set up JWT token system
5. Build authentication endpoints
