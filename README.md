# Shop'n'Bank

A full-stack banking and e-commerce application built with Go and React TypeScript. This project demonstrates the implementation of financial transactions, inventory management, and user authentication in a web application.

## About

This is a learning project focused on understanding REST API development with Go's standard library and building modern web interfaces with React TypeScript.

- Inter-user money transfers with atomic transactions
- Account balance tracking and deposits
- Multi-account support per user

### E-Commerce
- Product catalog with 100 demo items
- Inventory management and stock tracking
- Purchase transactions with account balance deduction
- Transaction history and receipts
- Admin product management interface

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control (user/admin)
- Protected API endpoints
- Session validation and token refresh
- Password hashing with bcrypt

## Tech Stack

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.23+
- Node.js 18+
- DynamoDB Local (for development)

### Backend Setup

1. **Navigate to backend directory**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   go mod download
   ```

3. **Setup environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```

4. **Start DynamoDB Local** (optional, for local development)
   ```bash
   # Download and run DynamoDB Local
   # https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/DynamoDBLocal.html
   ```

5. **Run the server**
   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

   Server will start on `http://localhost:8080`

### Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to frontend directory**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Frontend will start on `http://localhost:5173`

## ðŸ”§ Environment Variables

### Backend (.env)
```env
# Admin User
ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@example.com
ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin123
ADMIN_FULLNAME=System Administrator

# JWT Secret (change for production)
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key-here

# AWS Configuration
AWS_REGION=us-west-2
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=dummy          # For local DynamoDB
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=dummy       # For local DynamoDB

# DynamoDB (remove for production AWS)
DYNAMODB_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:8000
```

## Architecture

### Backend Design
The backend follows a layered architecture pattern:

- **Handlers Layer:** HTTP request/response handling, input validation
- **Service Layer:** Business logic, JWT token management
- **Repository Layer:** Data access abstraction, DynamoDB operations
- **Middleware:** Cross-cutting concerns (authentication, CORS, rate limiting)

**Key Patterns:**
- Uses DynamoDB TransactWriteItems for ACID-compliant operations
- Stateless design enables horizontal scaling
- Context propagation for request lifecycle management
- Optimistic locking prevents race conditions at the database level

### Frontend Design
The frontend is organized into a component-based architecture:

- **Pages:** Route-level components with data fetching
- **Components:** Reusable UI components
- **Services:** API communication layer
- **Utils:** Helper functions and utilities

**Key Patterns:**
- Protected routes with authentication checks
- Centralized API service with interceptors
- Token validation wrapper component
- Responsive design with Tailwind utilities

## ðŸ§ª API Endpoints
